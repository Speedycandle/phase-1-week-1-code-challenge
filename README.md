HOW TO USE:
Clone this repository to your local machine. Open the terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory. Open the speedDetector.js file in a code editor. Modify the speed variable to the desired car speed (in km/h). Save the changes in the speedDetector.js file. In the terminal or command prompt, run the program using the following command: node speedDetector.js The program will output the demerit points or "Ok" if the speed is within the limit. const speed = 80; const result = calculateDemeritPoints(speed); console.log(result);

3.NET SALARY CALCULATOR.
Net Salary Calculator This program calculates the net salary of an individual based on their basic salary and benefits. It considers the payee (tax), NHIF deductions, and NSSF deductions to determine the net salary.

To run the program, execute the netSalaryCalculator.js file using Node.js.

The program consists of the following functions:

calculateNetSalary: Calculates the net salary by computing the gross salary and deducting taxes and deductions. calculateGrossSalary: Calculates the gross salary by adding the basic salary and benefits. calculatePayeeTax: Determines the payee (tax) based on the gross salary and predefined tax rates. calculateNHIFDeductions: Calculates the NHIF deductions based on the basic salary and predefined thresholds. calculateNSSFDeductions: Calculates the NSSF deductions based on the basic salary. Ensure that Node.js is installed on your machine to run the program

Running the above example will output "Points: 2" to the console.
